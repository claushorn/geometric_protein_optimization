# Geometric Protein Optimization (GPO)

Preprint:

# Overview

We introduce GPO, an AI-native approach that optimizes protein function by combining a large number of mutations from diverse locations to fine-tune the global geometry of the protein.

The GPO algorithm BuildUp performs a sequence of discrete gradient ascent steps to optimize a protein's function, applying one mutation at a time. 


# Try it out live:


# Choice of reward function and model


# Private Instalation: Software Setup


# Hardware Requirements

We are using BuildUp with the BIND model as a reward function on a LS40 GPU, but it even works on a M3 Max MacBook Pro with 36GB of memory.
